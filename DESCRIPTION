Description: mbQTL is a statistical R package for simultanious 16srRNA,16srDNA(microbial) and variant,SNP,SNV 
(host) relationship,correlation,regression studies. We apply linear,logistic and correlation based statitistics 
to identify the relationships of taxa,genus,species and variant,SNP,SNV in the infected host. We produce 
various statitiscal significance measures such as P values,FDR,BC and probabaility estimation to show significance
of these relationships. Further we provide various visulaization function for ease and clarification of 
the results of these analysis. The package is compatible with dataframe, MRexperiment and text format.
