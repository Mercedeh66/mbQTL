Description: mbQTL is a statistical R package for simultaneous 16srRNA,16srDNA (microbial)
 and variant, SNP, SNV (host) relationship, correlation, regression studies.
 We apply linear, logistic and correlation based statistics to identify the relationships
 of taxa, genus, species and variant, SNP, SNV in the infected host. We produce various 
 statistical significance measures such as P values, FDR, BC and probability estimation to
 show significance of these relationships. Further we provide various visualization function
 for ease and clarification of the results of these analysis. The package is compatible with
 dataframe, MRexperiment and text formats.
